Is this an error?\nThe program still runs with a negative number because its still a whole number\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\nNo becau\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\n"
