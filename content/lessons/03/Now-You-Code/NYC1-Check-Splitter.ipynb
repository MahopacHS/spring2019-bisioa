What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\nThe program shows an error\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\nThis is a value error.\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \nThe program does not run and shows a value error. This makes sense because it is programmed to handle whole numbers for amount of people."
