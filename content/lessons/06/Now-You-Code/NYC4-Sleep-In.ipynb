Our criteria will be as follows.\n\n- Is it the weekend? Then sleep in.\n- Is it a holiday? Then sleep in.\n- Otherwise you need to get up!\n\nLet's write a program to input the day of the week and ask whether or not its a holiday, then make the appropriate decision as to whether or not we should sleep in.\n\nWe will use the **Write - Refactor - Test - Rewrite** approach to complete the final solution which will refactor the day of the week logic into a function."
